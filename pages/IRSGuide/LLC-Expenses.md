# IRS Guide - Itemizing Expenses

(Google 'LLC itemize expenses)

- LLC itemizes its expenses by deducting all "ordinary and necessary" business costs from its taxable income. 
- depends on how the LLC is taxed, but the principle is the same: 
- keeping detailed records of your business spending to reduce your tax bill. 

## Best practices for tracking expenses
To ensure you can successfully itemize your LLC's expenses and withstand an audit, follow these best practices: 
- `Separate business and personal finances`: Keep a dedicated bank account and credit card for all business-related transactions.
- `Keep detailed records`: Retain receipts, invoices, and bank statements for all business purchases. For meals and travel, document the business purpose, date, location, and attendees.
- `Use accounting software`: Use software like QuickBooks or other platforms to categorize and
   track expenses accurately.
- `Consult a tax professional`: Working with a CPA or tax attorney is especially important for
   complex situations to ensure you maximize your deductions while remaining compliant with IRS rules.

Business meals: Meals with clients, customers, or employees are typically 50% deductible, provided they are not lavish and have a clear business purpose.

## Professional services: 
- Fees paid to accountants, lawyers, and consultants for business-related services are fully deductible.

## Office supplies and equipment: 
The cost of items with a lifespan of less than a year, like paper and pens, can be deducted. Larger assets like computers and furniture are typically depreciated over time, though accelerated depreciation with Section 179 may apply.

## Advertising and marketing: 
Costs for promoting your business, including website development, online ads, and business cards, are fully deductible.

## How to file depending on your LLC type
Your filing method for itemizing business expenses will depend on your LLC's tax classification: 

### Single-member LLC: 
Expenses are reported on a Schedule C and filed with your personal Form 1040. You can also deduct half of your self-employment tax.

### Multi-member LLC (Partnership): 
The LLC files a partnership tax return (Form 1065) to report its income and deductions. The business's profits and losses pass through to the owners via a Schedule K-1, which each owner reports on their personal tax return.
