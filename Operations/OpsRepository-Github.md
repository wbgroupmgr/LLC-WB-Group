# Manage LLC via github


## to manage aspects of your LLC, you're essentially looking to 
- leverage its collaborative and
- organizational features for your business processes,
- code,
- documentation, and
- project management.

## Steps
### 1. Create a GitHub Organization
- Organizations are Ideal for Businesses:
    - Instead of using a personal GitHub account,
    - create a GitHub Organization.
    - This provides features like team management,
    - centralized billing, and
    - shared ownership of repositories,
    - which are crucial for business operations.
- Setup Process:
    - create a new organization by clicking the "+" icon on the top-right corner of GitHub
       selecting "New organization". 

### 2. Define your repositories
- Code Repositories: If your LLC involves software development, create repositories to host your code. Use private repositories for proprietary or sensitive code to restrict access to authorized team members.
- Documentation Repositories: Even if you're not primarily a software business, you can use repositories to store business documentation, policies, legal agreements, marketing materials, and other relevant information.
- Project Management Repositories: Utilize GitHub's project management features (issues, projects, boards) to track tasks, bugs, and milestones for your business projects. 
### 3. Invite collaborators and define roles
Add Team Members: Invite your LLC members or collaborators to the organization and assign them appropriate roles (e.g., owner, member) with relevant permissions for the repositories.
Leverage Teams: Create teams within your organization to mirror your internal structure or working groups, and assign repository permissions at the team level for more streamlined management. 
### 4. Implement best practices for security
Restrict Access: Employ the principle of least privilege, giving users only the necessary access to complete their tasks.
Secure Branches: Utilize branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to critical branches (like "main") and enforce code review workflows for quality assurance and security.
Avoid Sensitive Data in Repositories: Never store sensitive data like API keys, passwords, or confidential information directly in your repositories, especially public ones.
Enable 2FA: Require two-factor authentication (2FA) for all organization members to enhance account security.
Use Secret Scanning and Push Protection: Consider GitHub Advanced Security features like secret scanning and push protection to automatically detect and prevent accidental commits of sensitive information. 
### 5. Leverage project management features
Issues: Track bugs, feature requests, and tasks using GitHub Issues, assigning them to team members and setting due dates.
Projects: Utilize GitHub Projects to visually organize and track the progress of your projects using customizable boards and columns.
Discussions: Engage in discussions with your team members within GitHub to facilitate communication and collaboration. 

### 6. Consider open-sourcing aspects (optional)
- `Open-Source Specific Projects`:
    - You might decide to open-source certain parts of your business, like libraries or tools,
    - gain community contributions and exposure.
- License:
    - If you choose to open-source a project,
    - remember to include an open-source license (like MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPLv3) to explicitly define
    - how others can use, modify, and distribute your work. 
- Guidelines:
    - By following these guidelines, you can effectively use GitHub to manage various aspects of your LLC,
    - fostering collaboration, streamlining workflows, and maintaining a secure environment for your business processes.
