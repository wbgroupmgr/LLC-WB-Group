## IRS LLC Tips / Guide

Yes, you can deduct certain expenses incurred before your LLC is officially set up, provided those expenses are considered either `startup costs` or `organizational costs`. 

### 1. Startup costs

These are expenses you incur while investigating and preparing to operate your business before it officially opens its doors. They must be expenses that would normally be deductible if the business were already operating. 

Examples of deductible startup costs
- Market and product research
- Advertising costs
- Website development
- Employee training expenses
- Costs associated with finding financing, suppliers, customers, or distributors 

### 2. Organizational costs

These are expenses associated with formally establishing your LLC, such as filing fees and legal expenses related to creating the entity itself. 
Examples of deductible organizational costs
- Legal and accounting fees for forming the LLC
- State filing fees for your Articles of Organization 
- Deductions and limitations
- You can deduct up to $5,000 in startup costs and $5,000 in organizational costs in the year your business begins operations.
- However, if your total startup or organizational costs exceed $50,000, your first-year deduction for that category is reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount exceeding $50,000.
- Any remaining startup and organizational expenses that you can't deduct in the first year must be amortized (deducted in equal installments) over 180 months (15 years) starting from the month your business begins operating. You'll typically use IRS Form 4562 for this.
- For expenses to qualify, your business must actually start operating. If you research a business idea and then decide not to proceed, the costs are generally considered personal expenses and are not deductible. 

### Important considerations:
- Consult a tax professional: Tax laws are complex, and the specifics can depend on your individual circumstances and business structure.
- Keep thorough records: Maintain detailed records of all expenses and actions taken to launch your business. This includes receipts, invoices, and contracts.
- Know the difference between business and startup expenses: Once your business is up and running and generating revenue, ongoing expenses are generally deductible under different rules
